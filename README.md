# Procedurally-Generated-Universe
This is a demo of a procedurally generated universe written in Python.

It is based on One Lone Coder's video : Procedural Generation: Programming The Universe.

Except instead of writing it in C++ using his Pixel engine, I wrote it in Python using the Pygame Game Engine.

Obviously, there are alot of syntax changes. The most notable logic change is that I did not use his random
Double function, instead I opted to use the Python Random 
Library's Uniform function. There were also a lot of data 
structure changes as some of the data structures used in
his video were not avalible in python.

I also made the resolution a bit bigger.

This was only intended as a learning excerise.

# Requirements
To run this all you need to do is to install Pygame.

pip install pygame
